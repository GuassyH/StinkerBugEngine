Stinker Bug Game Engine made by me. This engine has an ECS that I made with the help of some studying. Learning a lot about Templates and std::enable_if_t.
Feel free to try to make something with this but it will probably be incredibly difficult haha.

to create an entity call Entity your_entity_name = scene.CreateEntity();
